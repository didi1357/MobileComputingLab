# SS 2020 448.066 MOBILE COMPUTING LABORATORY

This repository contains all data including code developed throughout the
mobile computing laboratory course at TU Graz.

This course is split into two parts:
+ First one is about developing a smartphone application which is able to detect
  a users activity using the KNN algorithm.
+ Second one is about extending this app to do the same using two kinds of
  machine learning. In detail, plain ML based on training on the WISDM dataset
  and using a Transfer Learning approach was necessary.

This already describes the purpose of the different folders within this
repository. The folder Latex contains the report submitted to the course
organization.

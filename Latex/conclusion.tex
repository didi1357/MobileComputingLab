\section{Conclusion}
As shown in \fref{sec:resultsML}, the \gls{knn} classifier worked better than expected as long as the phone is at the position at which it was during the initial recordings. The base model pre trained by the WISDM dataset did not provide good results in this case. The transfer learning based approach made it possible to train the neuronal network to a new smartphone position directly on the device.
